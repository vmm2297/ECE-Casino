2. On your PC, navigate to any directory where you want to save the folder of game files.
3. Right click and select `Git Bash Here` inside the directory.
4. Download the game folder with the command `git clone https://github.com/vmm2297/ECE-Casino.git`.

#Challenge Description
Project inspiration drawn from and originally created by the Kleiner Perkins Fellows Program

## Problem
Build a console-based (i.e. runs in terminal) unix-compatible interactive card game. You can pick Blackjack, Solitaire, Memory, or any other game of your choosing (please include game rules in this case).
 
Along with your code, include a design document covering:
1. Instructions for running your code and any tests you may have written
2. Rules for your card game, if not one of the three listed above
3. A brief explanation of your design choices and any data structures or algorithms that you implemented
4. Choice of tooling (language, libraries, test runner, etc.) and rationale behind those choices.

## Notes
1. The card game can be single or multiplayer
2. Many card games rely on the cards of a player being hidden from other players. You may want to consider implementing such a feature.
3. Feel free to use any programming language.
4. Please cite any external libraries that you use.
5. We suggest you spend no more than 3 hours on this challenge.
 
## How You Will Be Assessed
You will be assessed on your creativity and the quality of your code and design document. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Does the game work, i.e. is it possible to play a complete game of the card game you chose?
2. How thoughtful were your system design decisions?
3. Is the game designed well / easily playable?
4. Is the code organized, modular, and well-factored?
5. What edge cases were considered and accounted for?
